# Portfolio

> This is a capstone project for module 1 in which a website is made for a telethon. The complete website is responsive and is made for 2 screen sizes i.e for mobile max width 767 and for desktop min width 768. The featured speakers cards are displayed dynamically through JavaScript. 2 featured speakers are shown on the mobile version when the website loads but once the more button placed at the bottom of the home page is pressed, all speakers show up on the mobile version as well. 2 pages were made i.e the home page and about page for this project.
